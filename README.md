## 🌟 About Me

- 🧰 I build internal automation tools, real-time dashboards, and production-grade systems that improve engineering workflows.
- 🐳 Comfortable with Linux, Docker, CI/CD, and observability; I enjoy making deploys repeatable and recoveries fast.
- 🔧 Hands-on with Terraform/Ansible and cloud primitives (AWS EC2/EKS/S3/RDS/VPC); I like turning infra into code and docs.
- 🧠 Self-taught — transitioned from semiconductor engineering to full-stack → DevOps/SRE, always learning by doing.
- 🎮 Rhythm game fan (BanG Dream!) — clean metrics and tight feedback loops make me happy.

## 🚀 Projects

- **[Internal Evaluation Platform](https://github.com/akaBoyLovesToCode/sol-evaluation-system)** – Full-stack app (Flask APIs + Vue 3) with Dockerized deploys, JWT auth, i18n, and RBAC. Includes CI/CD pipelines and IaC demos (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI + container registry) for repeatable releases and ops workflows.
- **[MoviePilot Automation Plugins](https://github.com/sharkbeee/mpPlus)** – Python-based plugins with real-time event processing, reducing system IO load by 80%+ through optimization.
- **Data Analytics Dashboard** – PySide6 application with QML interface, PyEcharts visualization, and automated reporting system for production data analysis.

You can find more in my pinned repositories or ask me for a walkthrough!

## 🧠 Learning Journey

**Operating stack I ship with:** Linux • Docker • Nginx • Flask/FastAPI • Vue 3 • GitHub Actions/GitLab CI • AWS (EC2/EKS/S3/RDS) • Terraform • Prometheus/Grafana • Loki.

**Recently put into practice**
- **Kubernetes on AWS (EKS):** provisioned with Terraform; services deployed via Argo CD; HPA and PodDisruptionBudget configured; basic pod/node health monitors in place.
- **CI/CD:** containerized builds with tests → push to Artifactory → staged deploys; manual promote to production; test coverage tracked (~90%).
- **Observability:** Prometheus app metrics (latency/throughput/error), Alertmanager routing, Grafana release-health dashboards, and Loki for logs.
- **IaC & Ops automation:** reusable Terraform modules (VPC/EKS/RDS) plus Python/Shell ops scripts for health checks and zero-downtime DB migrations.

**Next focused improvements (short-term)**
- Blue/Green & Canary releases with Argo Rollouts on EKS.
- Hardening: IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) and NetworkPolicies.
- Reliability & cost guardrails: error budgets and basic capacity plans.
