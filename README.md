## 🌟 About Me

- 🧰 I build internal automation tools, real-time dashboards, and production systems that improve engineering workflows.
- 🐳 Experienced with containerized applications, database management, and cross-team collaboration tools.
- 🔧 Passionate about system reliability, monitoring solutions, and building scalable infrastructure.
- 🎮 Rhythm game fan (BanG Dream!), with a love for clean metrics and performance optimization.
- 🧠 Self-taught — transitioned from semiconductor engineering to full-stack development, always learning by doing.

I'm currently transitioning from full-stack development to a more infra-focused role, and I love diving deep into reliability, observability, and automation.
